Content:
phi_psi_vs_dist.gz  <- All recorded data
bb_movements.tab.gz <- Most relevant subset of phi_psi_vs_dist.gz

Desc:
These files contain data on protein pairs differing by just a single mutation.
They are mined from PDB and QC checked.
Data are extracted for all amino acids in the pair each geting their own data row i.e. a pair will have many data rows consecutively listed from N to C terminal.
To locate the position/row that has been mutated use the distance measure, the mutation is at 0 distance both 1D and 3D.

Fields (bb_movements only, for more details on all recorded data study the code):
pair_name: PDBfile1 dash PDBfile2
prot_len: Length of the protein
AA_wt: AA in PDBfile1
AA_mut: AA in PDBfile2
ss_wt: DSSP class in PDBfile1
ss_mut: DSSP class in PDBfile2
RASA_wt: Relative surface accessibility in PDBfile1
RASA_mut: Relative surface accessibility in PDBfile2
_3D_dist: Carbon alpha distance to mutated AA
_1D_dist: Protein sequence distance to mutated AA
N_dist: Distance from N terminal
C_dist: Distance from C terminal
dphi: Delta phi angle
dpsi: Delta psi angle
